## About me

My name is Matt Warner, I recently completed my Master's in Sound and Music Computing at Queen Mary's University of London (within the school of electrical enginnering & computer science) - achieving distinction (70%+). Previous to that I completed an MSci degree in Physics at the same university. My free time mainly consists of listening to and creating my own music in Abeleton.

## Master's dissertation

Titled 'The Determinant Interface Model for Music Cognition – Peeling Back the Cognitive Layers of Our Everyday Music Listening', my projected (where I achieved a mark of 80%) consisted of first hypothesising my own cognitive model through review reading the relvant literature (neurological, cognitive & behavioural studies), testing that model by use of 25 self gathered partispanets, and anaylsing the self collected data through code.

My research found that when hearing short melodies (10s) we judge our enjoyabilty purely based on how much "musical sense" it makes to our ear. However, by the use of different timbral sounds (like switching instruements or changing how the instruements sound "texturally") it allows for the listener to enjoy otherwise more complex, dissant sounding melodies. On top of this, the leading factor for music enjoyabilty was artist recongition over the actual musical piece it self i.e., it was found partispants based song enjoyability more so on the msucial artist themselves rather than the actual music, by quite a significant margin.
